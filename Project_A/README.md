Here is the explanation of what is included in the Supplementary file:


    1. mhist_dataset is a folder containing two subfolders, including the images and their annotations, for the MHIST dataset. All 3152 images are in the images.zip file. Annotations are included in annotations.csv. Note that this file includes each image file name and its corresponding majority-vote label and degree of annotator agreement expressed as the number of annotators who marked the image as SSA (e.g., 6 indicates 6/7 agreement with a ground truth of SSA, and 2 would indicate 5/7 agreement with a ground truth of HP).

    2.Task1.ipynb is a Python notebook showing how the teacher and student models are trained in the conventional KD framework. You will use this file to implement conventional KD for the MNIST dataset.

    3. Project_A_FAQs.pdf is a list of Frequently Asked Questions that try to throw light on (almost) all of your questions and concerns that you may have during Project A.
